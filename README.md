# SPACE INVADERS

I am making this game to learn the odin language.

This is the classic arcade game, space invaders. I try to stay close to the way it was working originally without obsessing about making it exactly the same.

It's really fun, I get why it is a classic.

todo:

- [x] aliens moving
- [x] player
- [x] bullets from player and aliens
- [x] protections exploding piece by piece
- [x] score calculation
- [x] difficulty with new round
- [ ] add ufo
- [ ] add menus
- [ ] make it loadable in the browser
- [ ] add leader board

# requirements

You need odin installed (https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/). Check this post/video by Karl Zylinski for some help: https://zylinski.se/posts/gamedev-for-beginners-using-odin-and-raylib-1/

He wrote a [book](https://odinbook.com/) about odin too, it's really good!

# running

To run the program you can run `odin run .` or `make run`.
